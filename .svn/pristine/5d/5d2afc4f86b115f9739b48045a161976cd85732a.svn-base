Thursday, June 30, 2016
All four of us met to discuss remaining work. We decided that we would try to
include editing and deleting recipes, and deleting reviews. Editing a review
seemed unnecessary, as they are most likely fast enough to create that a user
could simply delete and rewrite instead. We also decided to try to implement
searching for a recipe. We decided that any other user stories planned at the
beginning (ie: moderation system) would not be included.

Thursday, June 9, 2016
Chris Greening
    - Implemented GUI for adding a review - 5 hours

Thursday, June 9, 2016
	Group meeting: discussed what needs to be done.
	    - Do “Add a review” big story left over from iteration 1
		- Only UI needs to be done.

	Focus on implementing the user system. Big stories:
	    - Add a user
	    - View a user profile
	    - Delete a user

	Decided how to implement the user object.

	We also decided to treat these as detailed user stories. We broke these down
into developer tasks (listed in developer_tasks.txt).

	Finally, “edit” and “delete” recipe were deemed low priority, as it doesn’t
make sense to implement these without a user system in plane.
	
	We decided that Chris Greening would implement the GUI for adding a review,
Fujie would replace the stub database with a real database, and implement the functionality in the database for handling Users. Dylan would do each of the development tasks for the “View User Profile” story, and Chris Yip would implement the “Add A User” story.
