This project uses a 3 tier architecture. There are five packages, found in Project/app/src/main/java/comp3350.
Four represent major elements of the architecture - the business and objects packages represent the
business logic, the persistence and presentation packages represent their equivalient tiers. The
application package simply consists of some code needed to initialize the data. All of the xml files
can be found in Project/app/src/main/res.

The major features implemented at this point are the recipes themselves, the reviews, and the user
accounts. The log in screen is accessible from a link in the main screen. Users can view recipes and
 reviews while not logged in, but cannot add any. From the main screen, users can add a recipe,
 browse recipes, or search recipes by keyword. Selecting a recipe will show details (such as the
 instructions and ingredients list) and will display a link to the list of reviews, and a link to the
  author. The list of reviews again displays a list of abbreviated reviews, which can in turn be
  clicked to read the full text. New to iteration 3 is a search feature and the ability to modify
  posted content. Searching is possible through a button in the main screen. When a logged in user
  views their own recipe, they can edit or delete it; when they view their own review, they
  can delete it.

Sometimes the project cannot be run when the project checks out first time.
You should fix the local configure file, and restart Android Studio.

For running the app with the stub database, please change line 13 in application.Services.java:
    dataAccessService = new DataAccessStub(dbName);

For running the app with real database (HSQLDB), please change the line 13 in application.Services.java:
    dataAccessService = new DataAccessObject(dbName);

The file app/database/RB.script is used in the integration tests. After running, replace the contents
 with RB.script.orig to run integration tests again.
